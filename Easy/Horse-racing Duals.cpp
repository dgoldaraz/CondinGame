///What will I practice?

///Loops
///This puzzles shows that sometimes, the simplest solution is not performant enough. You will also learn to handle large arrays and experience with their processing time.
///External resources SortingLists
///Statement

///In this problem you have to find the two numbers that are closest to each other among a list of numbers. The list might be really large and force you to search for the best possible algorithmic complexity for your solution.

///Input
///Line 1: Number N of horses

///The N following lines: the strength Pi of each horse. Pi is an integer.

///Output
///The difference D between the two closest strengths. D is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
///Constraints
///1 < N  < 100000
///0 < Pi â‰¤ 10000000
///Example
///Input
///3
///5
///8
///9
///    Output
///      1
